# Weather Site

This repository houses a dynamic weather application built with React.js for the front-end and Node.js for the back-end API. Users can search for their desired location (city or coordinates) and retrieve current weather details, along with a 5-day forecast. The UI utilizes clean and engaging styling, while the app prioritizes modularity, clean coding practices, and robust error handling.
